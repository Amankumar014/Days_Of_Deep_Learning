** Perceptron **
This repository contains a simple demonstration of a perceptron, a fundamental building block of artificial neural networks. 
The perceptron is a binary classifier that takes multiple inputs and produces a single binary output.
This demonstration includes a Python implementation of a perceptron and a basic usage example.

** What is a Perceptron **
A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that serves as a basic building block in artificial neural networks.
It was introduced in the late 1950s by Frank Rosenblatt.
The perceptron is a mathematical model inspired by the functioning of a biological neuron in the human brain.
